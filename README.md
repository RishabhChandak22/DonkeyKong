# DonkeyKong
Mario and Donkey Kong will be a close resemblance to the classic Donkey Kong arcade game. The player will control Mario, who must climb ladders and avoid rolling barrels thrown by Donkey Kong to reach the top platform.

• Architected and engineered a platformer game on a microcontroller using embedded C/C++, simulating classic arcade mechanics such as gravity-based jumping, collision detection, and sprite-based movement
• Interfaced an LCD display, switches, and LEDs to render animated characters and game levels in real-time using a frame buffer and efficient update logic
• Designed game state logic and physics using finite state machines and fixed-point arithmetic for performance on resource-constrained hardware
• Integrated DAC output for sound generation and ADC input via a slide potentiometer to control game mechanics
